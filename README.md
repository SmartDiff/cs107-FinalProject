### Broader Impact and Inclusivity Statement

Although great improvements have been made in the world of STEM with regards to diversity and inclusivity, 
it is no secret that a lot of work remains to be done to bridge the gap between technological advancements 
and underrepresented groups. As we designed this software, we brainstormed ways to make it as inclusive as 
possible, recognizing that people from diverse technical backgrounds might engage with it in the future. 
Therefore, we decided to implement a graphic user interface (GUI) to make the user experience as friendly 
and smoothly as possible. That being said, although interacting with the software is straightforward, the 
interface is designed for English speakers and assumes familiarity with elementary and multivariable functions,
which could still act as barriers to future users. More work needs to be done to mitigate these effects as 
much as possible, and to make the user experience as informative and clear as possible. 

Our software has both positive and negative implications, but here we will argue that the positive ones 
outnumber the negative ones. On a technical level, we worked on making this software as time- and memory-
efficient as possible while also supporting complex operations involving higher order derivatives and 
multivariable functions. Since efficiency and scalability are important components of automatic differentiation, 
we believe we are contributing a new software to the broader community, making it more diverse. Also, as 
mentioned before, we directed our efforts to software inclusivity, though we recognize that more work in 
this area needs to be done. Finally, we are aware that job loss is a main concern that comes with several 
types of automation. However, instead of disrupting professional opportunities, we sincerely hope our tool 
will instead create opportunities for more people interested in using AD in their areas of research and work
and are currently not doing due to a lack of user-friendly software. However, in the case of such disruption
ever existing, efforts should be made to instruct people at risk on the usage of this software while making
the transition as easy as possible.
