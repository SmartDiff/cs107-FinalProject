For example, knowing the initial decomposition level of a contaminated food, \n we can define a differential equation to predict how food will decay in the future and set an appropriate expiration date. \n \n However, traditional methods of differentiation such as symbolic differentiation and numerical differentiation might be computationally expensive and less robust. Also, these methods do not scale well to vector functions with multiple variable inputs, which are widely used to solve real world problems.\n\n In this package, SmartDiff is a software package which implements a forward mode Automatic Differentiation (AD) package with chain rule to help users take derivatives easily. It automatically breaks the complex functions into small independent elementary operations based parentheses and operators. Then it calculates the derivatives in the small chunks step by step, moving outward to the entire function, to give the result. Therefore, SmartDiff is widely **generalizable** to different functions and **consumes very little memory**. It also computes the derivative of different components of the function in parallel, further speeding up the computation. \n","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","tags":[],"cell_id":"00000-1880b0fe-0687-4cdf-a63b-26c7845a0227"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Background\n\n## Chain Rule\n This automatic differentiation (AD) is performed mainly based on the chain rule. \n The basic idea is to split the function into hierarchies of chunks containing the input variables and the built-in elementary operations in SmartDiff. \n Therefore, from the innermost chunk(s), the calculation can be expressed in a series of steps iteratively, in which SmartDiff only considers one elementary operation at a time. \n After the evaluation of both the function and its derivatives, the iteration can be traced in the computation graph. \n\n Based on the key definition of chain rule, and known that $F(x) = f(g(x))$, we can represent it in multiple steps as follows:\n    $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(F(x)) =\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}f(g(x))=f'(g(x))g'(x)$\n\n From the equation above, as long as we can compute the derivative of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, we can get the derivative of $F(x)$.\n\nAlso, with such forward method, SmartDiff is able to evaluate each step of the calculation and keep track of function values and derivatives at each step, which makes the calculation faster and more robust.\n\n## Graph Structure of Calculation\n SmartDiff is implemented based on a graph structure. For each node on the graph, it contains a variable or the result following one elementary operation. \n For example, given a multivariable function $f(x,y) = (x^2+1)+\\exp{(y)}$. To evaluate the function at $(x,y) = (1,1)$, we can write the evaluation trace as:\n\n|     `Trace`        |   ` Operation`     |        `Value`         |    ` Derivative `       |  `Der to x `|            `Der to y`            |\n|: -----------------:|:------------------:|:----------------------:|:-----------------------:|:-----------:|:--------------------------------:|\n|        $x_1$       |       $x$          |          1             |       $ \\dot{x}$        |       1     |                 0                |\n|        $x_2$       |       $y$          |          1             |       $ \\dot{y}$        |       0     |                 1                |\n|        $v_1$       |     $x_1^2$        |          1             |       $2x_1\\dot{x_1}$   |       2     |                 0                |\n|        $v_2$       |     $v_1+1$        |          2             |          $\\dot{v_1}$    |       2     |                 0                |\n|        $v_3$       |     $\\exp{(x_2)}$  |          $e$           |  $\\exp{(x_2)}\\dot{x_2}$ |       0     |               $e$                |\n|         $f$        |     $v_2+v_3$      |          $e+2$         |  $\\dot{v_2}+\\dot{v_3}$  |       2     |               $e$                |\n\nThe traces above split the function into chunks of elementary operations and can be easily put into a graph structure as following, which is helpful for the differentiation calculation.\n\n![graph_structure](figures/graph.PNG)\n\n## Elementary Functions\n SmartDiff is mainly a combination of elementary operations in calculus, which contains:\n \n 1. Arithmetic symbols (+, -, Ã—, /), parentheses, constant functions ($2$, $\\pi$, $e$, etc.)\n 2. Logarithmic functions, exponential functions, trigonometric functions, square root function, hyperbolic functions, etc. ","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","tags":[],"cell_id":"00001-e4cec731-17d4-4c6a-8917-08832f84a123"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How to use SmartDiff\n\n1. Installation \n\n    The user first installs SmartDiff and calls the main script in the commandline and interacts with the Graphic User Interface (GUI). **There is no need to import or instantiate python objects.**\n    \n    ```python\n        git clone https://github.com/SmartDiff/cs107-FinalProject.git\n        # pip install SmartDiff # For future\n        python /dir/to/cs107-FinalProject/main.py\n    ```\n    \n    PyQt5 should be automatically installed as it is specified in requirements.txt. In case the user gets \"cannot find module PyQt5\" in the command line, do the following to install PyQt5 (default 5.15.1)\n\n    ```python\n        pip install PyQt5\n    ```\n\n2. Interaction with GUI\n\n    Calling the main.py script in the command line should initiate a GUI.\n\n    <img src=\"figures/step1.PNG\" style=\"width:500px;\">\n\n    User can choose the dimension of the vector function and the number of input variables. Click ok to continue. The instructions to input the variables and function components are listed here for later steps.\n\n    Once the user clicks OK, the user sees the second step GUI, where the user can put in a float between -100 and 100 with up to 4 decimals.\n\n    <img src=\"figures/step2.PNG\" style=\"width:500px;\">\n\n    Click OK or press Enter to continue to step 3 as shown below. Do not press Cancel!\n\n    <img src=\"figures/step3.PNG\" style=\"width:500px;\">\n\n    The user can input any function. In this example the user input $\\exp(\\frac{\\cos(2x_1)+3}{\\log_2{x_1}})$. Again, press OK or press Enter to continue to step 4. Note that SmartDiff has some built-in simple error handling, so $x$, $x_1$, and $x1$ will later be recognized as $x1$.\n \n    <img src=\"figures/step4.PNG\" style=\"width:500px;\">\n\n    This is for the user to confirm the input (no change allowed at this stage). The user can choose to show the function evaluated at this point by clicking the checkbox. Click OK to continue to step 5.\n\n    <img src=\"figures/step5.PNG\" style=\"width:500px;\">\n\n    SmartDiff is able to handle the error message during differentiation and function evaluation. In this case, $\\log_2(0)$ is an invalid operation and the error message is shown. The user is then instructed to go back to step 1 to fix the issue.\n\n    Then, if the user evaluates the function at $x1=10$, SmartDiff runs successfully as shown below.\n\n    <img src=\"figures/step4_fix.PNG\" style=\"width:500px;\">\n\n    <img src=\"figures/step5_fix.PNG\" style=\"width:500px;\">\n\n    Press Quit to exit the program or close step 4 and 5 windows to differentiate another function.","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","tags":[],"cell_id":"00002-2ac024b1-909e-4391-aab6-b46bf4a48214"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# SmartDiff Graphic User Interface (GUI)\n\n### Procedure:\n\nOnce SmartDiff is installed, it outputs the derivative(s) in the following steps.  \n\n   1.

Testing Procedure\nWe started by implementing some basic test cases in the docstring. For extensive testing between the boundaries of different modules, we will implement test functions for each module\non separate files within the same directory. The tests we have implemented so far cover all functions from *element_op.py*, *integrator.py*, *pyexpr_formatter.py*, which check the correct definition and\ncalculation of the derivatives for elementary operations and user input string formatting, respectively.\n\nThe automatic testing of our code is conducted using TravisCI and the proportion of code tested is monitored by CodeCov.\n\n### 3. Packaging and Package Distribution\nWe will be using Python Package Index (PyPI) to pack up our project and distribute it to the Python user community. \nThe PyPI of our package is \"smartdiff\", the same name to be used in pip install.  \nWe will write a *setup.py* file, a build script of setuptools and will be used to generate distribution archive files. Then we generate our project API token and upload the files to TestPyPI.\n\nFor now, people can interact with this package as shown in \"How to use SmartDiff\".\n\n### 4. Other Considerations\nSince users may have different local environments from the one developments are based on, we are researching into methods that can help users install the dependencies of smartdiff.\nWe found two ways to handle dependency requirements: \n\n1. install_require() function from the setuptools package.\n\n2. specify our own requirement file.\n\nBasic idea of SmartDiff:\n\nFrom the user input in GUI, we can simultaneously\n\n1. get a python expression from user input string\n\n2. constrain user input dimensions (variable and function) to a limited set\n\n3. display input instructions, results, and error messsages\n\nFor each component of the vector function, we start from the inner most expression and propagate outward as in forward mode of automatic differentiation.","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","tags":[],"cell_id":"00004-53ac6421-7441-4699-b81e-3cc972a98951"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Implementation\n\n### 1. Core Data Structures\nThe core data structures are queue, stack and hashmap. The queue is used to store the filtered characters when we are formatting the input via linear scanning.\nIt is also used to evaluate the mathematical expression in Python. Stack is used by Python internally to evaluate expressions nested in parenthesis. \nHashmap is used by our GUI to store the input variable name and value. We use numpy array for the automatic differentiation module and the GUI.\n\n### 2. Classes, Methods and Name Attributes\nThe core idea of our SmartDiff is to first format the user's input expression into a python expression. And then use Python's built-in eval() function to evaluate the result.\nSince Python compiler needs to know the value of each variable in the expression, we have our GUI to register the input variable name as a string and the value as an AutoDiff object initialized with the numerical value.\nThen we use eval() on the formatted expression and the hashmap of variable to the corresponding AD object to evaluate the final function value and derivative.  \n**Note: For now, our project handles only unary input, but we will modify our implementation to handle multi-input scenarios.**\n\n- PyExpression_Formatter() class  \n   - \\[Field\\] special_char_set: A set of legal special characters in the user's function input   \n   - \\[Method\\] is_valid_input: 0 if input string is valid, 1 if input string contains mismatched parenthesis, 2 if input string contains illegal characters\n   - \\[Method\\] format_to_pyexpr: Formats the input string to a Python compatible and compilable math expression \n    \n- Elementary_Op script  \nThis script contains a method for each type of elementary math operator below.
