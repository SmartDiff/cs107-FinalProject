    "# Introduction\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    " Taking derivatives is an ubiquitous tool that covers a wide range of applications - from mathematics, to physics and computer science, etc. \n",
    " \n",
    " In machine learning, differentiation is extensively applied to the optimization problem by performing the gradient descent to minimize the cost function. \n",
    "Using a fast and versatile differentiation method, people can also get the second order derivatives and hessian matrices.\n",
    " \n",
    " Differentiation is also applied to solve everyday problems. For example, knowing the initial decomposition level of a contaminated food, \n",
    " we can define a differential equation to predict how food will decay in the future and set an appropriate expiration date. \n",
    " \n",
    " However, traditional methods of differentiation such as symbolic differentiation and numerical differentiation might be computationally expensive and less robust. Also, these methods do not scale well to vector functions with multiple variable inputs, which are widely used to solve real world problems.\n",
    "\n",
    " In this package, SmartDiff is a software package which implements a forward mode Automatic Differentiation (AD) package with chain rule to help users take derivatives easily. It automatically breaks the complex functions into small independent elementary operations based parentheses and operators. Then it calculates the derivatives in the small chunks step by step, moving outward to the entire function, to give the result. Therefore, SmartDiff is widely **generalizable** to different functions and **consumes very little memory**. It also computes the derivative of different components of the function in parallel, further speeding up the computation. \n"

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chain Rule\n",
    " This automatic differentiation (AD) is performed mainly based on the chain rule. \n",
    " The basic idea is to split the function into hierarchies of chunks containing the input variables and the built-in elementary operations in SmartDiff. \n",
    " Therefore, from the innermost chunk(s), the calculation can be expressed in a series of steps iteratively, in which SmartDiff only considers one elementary operation at a time. \n",
    " After the evaluation of both the function and its derivatives, the iteration can be traced in the computation graph. \n",
    "\n",
    " Based on the key definition of chain rule, and known that $F(x) = f(g(x))$, we can represent it in multiple steps as follows:\n",
    "    $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(F(x)) =\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}f(g(x))=f'(g(x))g'(x)$\n",
    "\n",
    " From the equation above, as long as we can compute the derivative of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, we can get the derivative of $F(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, with such forward method, SmartDiff is able to evaluate each step of the calculation and keep track of function values and derivatives at each step, which makes the calculation faster and more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph Structure of Calculation\n",
    " SmartDiff is implemented based on a graph structure. For each node on the graph, it contains a variable or the result following one elementary operation. \n",
    " For example, given a multivariable function $f(x,y) = (x^2+1)+\\exp{(y)}$. To evaluate the function at $(x,y) = (1,1)$, we can write the evaluation trace as:\n",

    "# SmartDiff Graphic User Interface (GUI)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once SmartDiff is installed, it outputs the derivative(s) in the following steps.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. The user chooses the dimension of the vector function from a drop down list (1,2,3) and the number of one-dimensional real-valued variables from a drop down list (1,2,3)\n",
    "  \n",
    "   2. The user inputs a specific data point (required)\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. The user inputs a vector function by each component of the vector function\n",
    "\n",
    "   4. The user checks the confirmation message, showing the function and the variable values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   5. The user can choose to see the function value and the trace table in addition to the differentiation result.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   6. The user clicks Ok to differentiate.\n",
    "\n",
    "   7. The program shows the results based on user specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the buttons of functions, operators, and digits, the GUI can directly translate the user input into a defined string for latex rendering and a python expression for function evaluation and differentiation. This also alleviates the need to check for typos and undefined functions within the user input.\n"

    "### 2. Testing Procedure\n",
    "For each function, we will have some basic test cases in the docstring. For extensive testing between the boundaries of different modules, we will implement several test functions for each module \n",
    "on separate files under /tests. These tests will include the functions *element_op_tests*, *integrator_tests*, *find_value_tests*, and *trace_table_tests*, which will check the correct definition of \n",
    "derivatives for elementary operations, the successful implementation of those derivatives in a given equation, and the correct generation of a trace table, respectively. All of the tests functions will\n",
    "be called under a main test calling function, *all_tests*, to ensure that all the tests are running. The automatic testing of our code will be conducted using TravisCI and the proportion of code \n",
    "tested will be monitored by CodeCov.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Packaging and Package Distribution\n",
    "We will be using Python Package Index (PyPI) to pack up our project and distribute it to the Python user community. \n",
    "The PyPI of our package is \"smartdiff\", the same name to be used in pip install.  \n",
    "setup.py file is a build script of setuptools and will be used to generate distribution archive files. Then we generate our project API token and upload the files to TestPyPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Other Considerations\n",
    "Since users may have different local environments from the one developments are based on, we are researching into methods that can help users install the dependencies of smartdiff.\n",
    "We found two ways to handle dependency requirements: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. install_require() function from the setuptools package.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. specify our own requirement file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic idea of SmartDiff:\n",
    "\n",
    "From the user input in GUI, we can simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "1. render a latex expression of the function\n",
    "\n",
    "2. get a python expression  \n",
    "\n",
    "    For each component of the vector function, we divide it into chunks by parentheses (priority) and operators, then start from the innermost chunk(s) and evaluate the derivatives outward."

    "### 1. Core Data Structures\n",
    "One of the core data structures is stack.  \n",
    "When users type in the equations from left to right, they may create a few nested expressions. So the input parser needs to keep track of the terms at each level. Whenever we encounter an open parenthesis, we need to start a new level on top of the stack and add expression at that nested level as operand tuples.\n",
    "Whenever a level terminates (i.e. the closing parenthesis is encountered), we need to pop the expression off from the top of stack and evaluate its derivative with respect to the target variable. \n",

    "  \n",
    "- ElementaryGrad() class  \n",
    "This class has a method for each type of operator above. Each method returns an new Operand object which is the derivative with respect to one input operand.\n",
    "The base case of evaluating the derivative is 1. taking derivative of a single operand 2. taking derivative of two operands connected with an operator with respect to one operand.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- InputScanner() class   \n",
    "This class provides two methods described below:\n",
    "   - tokenize(input_str, dx_str): scans the input string and outputs a nested list of operand-operator tuples and an operand for \"dx_str\".  \n",
    "   - to_latex_format(input_str, dx_str): converts the input string into a latex string to be displayed in the GUI.\n",
    "  \n",

    "This class takes evaluates the derivative of a tokenized expression.\n",

    "   - Pandas, for generating the trace table\n",
    "   - Pydoc, for viewing the function docstring\n",
    "   - doctest, for unit testing of all the cases a function deals with (in a function docstring)\n",
