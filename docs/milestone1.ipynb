For example, knowing the initial decomposition level of a contaminated food, \n we can define a differential equation to predict how food will decay in the future and set an appropriate expiration date. \n \n However, traditional methods of differentiation such as symbolic differentiation and numerical differentiation might be computationally expensive and less robust. Also, these methods do not scale well to vector functions with multiple variable inputs, which are widely used to solve real world problems.\n\n In this package, SmartDiff is a software package which implements a forward mode Automatic Differentiation (AD) package with chain rule to help users take derivatives easily. It automatically breaks the complex functions into small independent elementary operations based parentheses and operators. Then it calculates the derivatives in the small chunks step by step, moving outward to the entire function, to give the result. Therefore, SmartDiff is widely **generalizable** to different functions and **consumes very little memory**. It also computes the derivative of different components of the function in parallel, further speeding up the computation. \n","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","tags":[],"cell_id":"00000-4ed2f716-b288-49ab-a0eb-875f12b59128"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Background\n\n## Chain Rule\n This automatic differentiation (AD) is performed mainly based on the chain rule. \n The basic idea is to split the function into hierarchies of chunks containing the input variables and the built-in elementary operations in SmartDiff. \n Therefore, from the innermost chunk(s), the calculation can be expressed in a series of steps iteratively, in which SmartDiff only considers one elementary operation at a time. \n After the evaluation of both the function and its derivatives, the iteration can be traced in the computation graph. \n\n Based on the key definition of chain rule, and known that $F(x) = f(g(x))$, we can represent it in multiple steps as follows:\n    $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(F(x)) =\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}f(g(x))=f'(g(x))g'(x)$\n\n From the equation above, as long as we can compute the derivative of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, we can get the derivative of $F(x)$.\n\nAlso, with such forward method, SmartDiff is able to evaluate each step of the calculation and keep track of function values and derivatives at each step, which makes the calculation faster and more robust.\n\n## Graph Structure of Calculation\n SmartDiff is implemented based on a graph structure. For each node on the graph, it contains a variable or the result following one elementary operation. \n For example, given a multivariable function $f(x,y) = (x^2+1)+\\exp{(y)}$. To evaluate the function at $(x,y) = (1,1)$, we can write the evaluation trace as:\n\n|     `Trace`        |   ` Operation`     |        `Value`         |    ` Derivative `       |  `Dev to x `|            `Dev to y`            |\n|: -----------------:|:------------------:|:----------------------:|:-----------------------:|:-----------:|:--------------------------------:|\n|        $x_1$       |       $x$          |          1             |       $ \\dot{x}$        |       1     |                 0                |\n|        $x_2$       |       $y$          |          1             |       $ \\dot{y}$        |       0     |                 1                |\n|        $v_1$       |     $x_1^2$        |          1             |       $2x_1\\dot{x_1}$   |       2     |                 0                |\n|        $v_2$       |     $v_1+1$        |          2             |          $\\dot{v_1}$    |       2     |                 0                |\n|        $v_3$       |     $\\exp{(x_2)}$  |          $e$           |  $\\exp{(x_2)}\\dot{x_2}$ |       0     |               $e$                |\n|         $f$        |     $v_2+v_3$      |          $e+2$         |  $\\dot{v_2}+\\dot{v_3}$  |       2     |               $e$                |\n\nThe traces above split the function into chunks of elementary operations and can be easily put into a graph structure, which is helpful for the differentiation calculation.\n\n## Elementary Functions\n SmartDiff is mainly a combination of elementary operations in calculus, which contains:\n \n 1. Arithmetic symbols (+, -, Ã—, /), parentheses, constant functions ($2$, $\\pi$, $e$, etc.)\n 2. Logarithmic functions, exponential functions, trigonometric functions, square root function, hyperbolic functions, etc. ","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","tags":[],"cell_id":"00001-6d43d0ad-8311-42f9-9b37-fae6591495d9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How to use SmartDiff\n\n1.

Testing Procedure\nFor each function, we will have some basic test cases in the docstring. For extensive testing between the boundaries of different modules, we will implement several test functions for each module \non separate files under /tests. These tests will include the functions *element_op_tests*, *integrator_tests*, *find_value_tests*, and *trace_table_tests*, which will check the correct definition of \nderivatives for elementary operations, the successful implementation of those derivatives in a given equation, and the correct generation of a trace table, respectively. All of the tests functions will\nbe called under a main test calling function, *all_tests*, to ensure that all the tests are running. The automatic testing of our code will be conducted using TravisCI and the proportion of code \ntested will be monitored by CodeCov.\n\n### 3. Packaging and Package Distribution\nWe will be using Python Package Index (PyPI) to pack up our project and distribute it to the Python user community. \nThe PyPI of our package is \"smartdiff\", the same name to be used in pip install.  \nsetup.py file is a build script of setuptools and will be used to generate distribution archive files. Then we generate our project API token and upload the files to TestPyPI.\n\n### 4. Other Considerations\nSince users may have different local environments from the one developments are based on, we are researching into methods that can help users install the dependencies of smartdiff.\nWe found two ways to handle dependency requirements: \n\n1. install_require() function from the setuptools package.\n\n2. specify our own requirement file.\n\nBasic idea of SmartDiff:\n\nFrom the user input in GUI, we can simultaneously\n\n1. render a latex expression of the function\n\n2. get a python expression  \n\n    For each component of the vector function, we divide it into chunks by parentheses (priority) and operators, then start from the innermost chunk(s) and evaluate the derivatives outward.","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","tags":[],"cell_id":"00003-92baae70-525a-4a1f-853f-95cee5d6f7bf"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Implementation\n\n### 1. Core Data Structures\nOne of the core data structures is stack.  \nWhen users type in the equations from left to right, they may create a few nested expressions. So the input parser needs to keep track of the terms at each level. Whenever we encounter an open parenthesis, we need to start a new level on top of the stack and add expression at that nested level as operand tuples.\nWhenever a level terminates (i.e. the closing parenthesis is encountered), we need to pop the expression off from the top of stack and evaluate its derivative with respect to the target variable. \nIf a terminated level of expression does not contain the target variable, we can simply leave it as a generic operand as a whole and continue the parsing.    \n\n### 2. Classes, Methods and Name Attributes\nFor now, we have identified 5 basic classes as follows. However, we may add or delete some of them depending on how the fundamental algorithm works.\n- Operand() class  \n   - type: \"numeral\" or \"var\" since the type of each operand can either be a variable or a numerical value. If it is a mixed type, as long as there is a variable, its type will be \"var\".\n   - value: string representation of the variable or numerical value\n   - has_target_var: True if this operand contains the target variable (since this operand will be treated as a variable in the outer expression levels); False otherwise.\n  \n- Operator() class  \nThis is an Enum class that holds the string ID of each mathematical operators the differentiator can handle. Its attributes are the uppercase name of each operator.\n  \n- ElementaryGrad() class  \nThis class has a method for each type of operator above. Each method returns an new Operand object which is the derivative with respect to one input operand.\nThe base case of evaluating the derivative is 1. taking derivative of a single operand 2. taking derivative of two operands connected with an operator with respect to one operand.  \n  \n- InputScanner() class   \nThis class provides two methods described below:\n   - tokenize(input_str, dx_str): scans the input string and outputs a nested list of operand-operator tuples and an operand for \"dx_str\".  \n   - to_latex_format(input_str, dx_str): converts the input string into a latex string to be displayed in the GUI.\n  \n- Differentiator() class  \nThis class takes evaluates the derivative of a tokenized expression.\n   - grad(expr, dx): It processes a nested list of tuples and iteratively computes the derivative with respect to the operand \"dx\".\n   \n- GUI() class  \nThis class will be based on the python GUI package, PyQt5 and uses the following predefined python classes to \ninform the user with instructions and error messages, direct the user to input the information, and display the output:\n   - QComboBox, QLineEdit, QPushButton, QLabel, QCheckBox, QMessageBox\n\n\n### 3. External Dependencies\n\n   - PyQt5, for the UI\n   - NumPy, for the solvers\n   - Pandas, for generating the trace table\n   - Pydoc, for viewing the function docstring\n   - doctest, for unit testing of all the cases a function deals with (in a function docstring)\n   - pytest, for testing files in test (extensive testing of boundaries between different modules)\n   - setuptools & wheel, for packaging and distributing the code \n   - twine, for uploading the distribution archive files\n\n### 4. Handle Elementary Functions like sin, sqrt, log, and exp (and all the others)\n\n   We will be using operator overloading to define the derivative of each elementary functions in SmartDiff/solvers. For example, $\\sin(x)$ will be mapped to $\\cos(x)$ and $x+y$ will still be $x+y$.","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","tags":[],"cell_id":"00004-2b1cd838-5b45-4bee-9b29-163370ffa6bb"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","tags":[],"cell_id":"00006-7d1cbc99-4199-4229-abaf-6083eeed55d0"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"orig_nbformat":2,"deepnote_notebook_id":"1fbda4a0-a60e-4996-912f-d9961332994a","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
